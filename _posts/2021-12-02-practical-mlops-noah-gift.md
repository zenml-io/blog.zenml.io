What does the machine learning production stack of the future look like? Should
we expect a thousand and one unique configurations, or will there be one
deployment tool to rule them all? Our latest podcast guest,
[Noah Gift](https://noahgift.com), gave us his thoughts on these questions and a
whole lot more in our new episode of
[_Pipeline Conversations_](https://podcast.zenml.io).

Noah is the founder of [Pragmatic A.I. Labs](https://paiml.com), where they
produce [videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/PragmaticAILabs),
[books and courses](https://paiml.com/docs/home/) to support those hoping to get
into the field. He also lectures at various universities in the United States
and teaches online courses as well. From earlier in his career, Noah also has
film credits in many major motion pictures for technical work, including
_Avatar_, _Spider-Man 3_, and _Superman Returns_.

[_Practical MLOps_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-mlops/9781098103002/)
is Noah's latest book, co-written with
[Alfredo Deza](https://github.com/alfredodeza). It covers a wide range of
practical ways to work with machine learning models in production. The book
takes a thoroughly hands-on approach — one honed through the experience that
Noah has teaching, one would imagine — and it's a useful way to get your hands
dirty in a huge number of different ways. If you're new to the field, there are
dozens of small projects to try out at the end of each chapter.

Noah also shared his hard-won experiences from working to build up a sports
social media startup, as well as his sense of what would be a good place to
start as someone seeking to build up their own practical experience in MLOps.
