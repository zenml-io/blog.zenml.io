This week I spoke with [Matt Squire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-squire-a19896125/), the CTO and co-founder of [Fuzzy Labs](https://www.fuzzylabs.ai/), where they help partner organizations think through how best to productionize their machine learning workflows.

Matt and FuzzyLabs are also behind the '[Awesome Open Source MLOps](https://github.com/fuzzylabs/awesome-open-mlops)' GitHub repo where you can find all the options for an open-source MLOps stack of your dreams.

Matt has been an enthusiastic early supporter of the work we do at ZenML so it was really amazing to get to talk to him and  get his take based on the many experiences he's had seeing how machine learning is done out in the field.

In this clip, Matt talks through the components that would make up his ideal MLOps stack:
