In today's information age, we are bombarded with a constant stream of news 
and media from a variety of sources. Summarizing tasks, particularly when it 
comes to news sources, can be a powerful tool for the efficient consumption of 
information. They distill complex or lengthy content into easily 
digestible chunks that can be scanned and absorbed quickly, allowing us to 
keep up with the news without being overwhelmed. They can also help us separate 
the signal from the noise, highlighting the most important details and helping 
us identify what's worth further investigation. 

## What we built: ZenNews

This is where **ZenNews** come into play. It offers a tool that uses 
[ZenML](https://zenml.io/home) to automate the summarization process and save 
users time and effort while providing them with the information they need. 
This can be particularly valuable for busy professionals or anyone who wants 
to keep up with the news but doesn't have the time to read every article in 
full.

## Why did we build it?

Apart from the advantages of solving a summarization task itself, this 
project aims to showcase some key benefits of using ZenML.

1. **_ZenML features a simple and clean Python SDK._** In this project, we 
leverage it to define our [steps](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zen-news-summarization/src/zennews/steps) 
and [pipelines](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/blob/main/zen-news-summarization/src/zennews/pipelines/zen_news_pipeline.py) 
and to access/manage the resources and artifacts that we interact with along 
the way. This project shows how this such a design can significantly simplify 
the process of building robust applications.

2. **_ZenML is an extensible framework._** We realize that ML projects often 
require custom-tailored solutions that deviate from off-the-shelf offerings. 
This is why we employed base abstractions that empower users to craft their 
solutions without needlessly reinventing the wheel. Take, for instance, [the 
custom materializer](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/blob/main/zen-news-summarization/src/zennews/materializers/article_materializer.py) 
and [the custom stack component](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/blob/main/zen-news-summarization/src/zennews/alerter/discord_alerter.py) 
showcased in this project to see how effortlessly one can implement custom 
solutions.

3. **_ZenML separates your code from your stack._** In other words, it offers a 
distinct separation between the code and the underlying infrastructure. As you 
explore this example, you'll notice how this separation can allow you to switch 
effortlessly between [a local default stack and a remote deployment with 
scheduled pipelines](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zen-news-summarization#-switching-to-scheduled-pipelines-with-vertex), 
all with the simple flip of a flag. 

4. **_ZenML can help you to scale up._** While this PoC-like example serves as 
evidence of ZenML's potential to streamline workflows and hasten the development 
process, it merely scratches the surface of its capabilities. To delve deeper 
into the extensive possibilities that ZenML has to offer, we encourage you to 
check out our [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/introduction).

## How does it work?

The **ZenNews** project is designed as a 
[PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/zennews/)
that you can install through `pip`:

```bash
pip install zennews
```

It includes a main pipeline called `zen_news_pipeline` with three steps: 
`collect`, `summarize`, and `report`. In this version, the only `collect` step 
implementation is the `bbc_news_source` that collects articles from the BBC 
news feed, whereas the only `summarize` step implementation uses the 
`bart_large_cnn_samsum` model to generate summaries, and the only `report` step 
creates a report and share the results using an alerter. Additionally, the 
package includes a custom stack component called `DiscordAlerter`.

Lastly, the package also includes a CLI application named `zennews`, which 
serves as the primary interface for interacting with the pipeline and its steps.

```bash
zennews --help 
```

# How do I use it?

Once you have installed the `zennews` package, you can immediately test it 
locally. By running the following command, you will retrieve the top five 
articles from the BBC news feed, summarize them, and display the results:

```bash
zennews bbc
```

As an output, you should see:

```bash
                 ______          _   _                   
                |___  /         | \ | |                  
                   / / ___ _ __ |  \| | _____      _____ 
                  / / / _ \ '_ \| . ` |/ _ \ \ /\ / / __|
                 / /_|  __/ | | | |\  |  __/\ V  V /\__ \
                /_____\___|_| |_|_| \_|\___| \_/\_/ |___/
                                                                               
                      This is where you get the news.
         
This will change your active ZenML stack to the default stack and run the 
pipeline locally. This also means that the pipeline will download and utilize 
the model locally.

You can also parameterize this process. In order to see the possible 
parameters, please use:

```bash
zennews bbc --help
```

To fully utilize the potential of an application like `zennews`, it's 
recommended to schedule the summarization pipelines instead of manually 
triggering them. This is possible by using `--schedule` if you have a ZenML 
stack which features an orchestrator that supports scheduling. 

```bash
zennews bbc --schedule daily
```

If you would like to see, how you can set up such a stack, you can visit [the
GitHub page](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/zen-news-summarization).
