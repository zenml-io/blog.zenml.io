title: "What's New in v0.13.0 and v0.13.1: Spark Integration, Custom Code Deployment and Stack Recipes!"
description: "This release brings the first iteration of Apache Spark integration into ZenML. This integration opens up the possibility of running large-scale workloads on single-node machines or clusters. Additionally, this release also opens up the possibility of running custom code along with your models using KServe or Seldon. Lastly, we introduce the Stack Recipe as a convenient way to spin up perfectly configured infrastructure with ease."

ZenML version 0.13.0 is chock-full with exciting features including:

* You can now run Spark jobs within ZenML with the long awaited Spark integration.
* It's now possible to run custom code alongside your model with KServe and Seldon.
* We introduce a convenient way to spin up infrastructures with Stack Recipes.

ZenML 0.13.1 comes with several quality of life improvements:

* Specify the exact order in which your pipelines steps should be
executed, e.g., via `step_b.after(step_a)`
* It's now possible to use TensorBoard with PyTorch and other modeling frameworks.
* You can now configure the Evidently integration to ignore specific columns in 
your datasets. 

As always, we've also included various bug fixes and lots of improvements to the documentation and our examples.

## ‚ö° Spark Integration
To date, [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) has been the most requested feature on our [Roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap).

We heard you! And in this release, we present to you the long-awaited Spark integration!

With Spark, this release brings distributed processing into the ZenML toolkit. You can now run heavy data processing workloads across machines/clusters as part of your MLOps pipeline.

## üéØ Custom Code Deployment

[Custom Code Deployment](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/custom_code_deployment) is the
continuation of the [Model Deployment](2022-03-02-continuous-deployment.md) story that we have been working on over the last few releases. 
Now it is possible to [deploy custom code along with your models using KServe or Seldon](2022-08-03-deploy-with-kserve.md).

## ü•ò Spin Up Infrastructure with Stack Recipes

Spinning up and configuring infrastructure is a difficult part of the MLOps journey 
and can easily become a barrier to entry. Using our [mlops-stacks](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks)
repository, it is now possible to spin up perfectly-configured infrastructure with
the corresponding ZenML stack using the ZenML CLI.

## üíî Breaking Changes

This release introduces a breaking change to the CLI by adjusting the access to
the stack component specific resources for `secret-managers` and 
`model-deployers` to be more explicitly linked to the component. Here is how:

```bash
# `zenml secret register ...` becomes 
zenml secrets-manager secret register ...

# `zenml served_models list` becomes 
zenml model-deployer models list
```
