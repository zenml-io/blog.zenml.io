Today, ZenML is announcing its first external investment round and it's a
special day for us. We are now backed by the most exciting investors in
open-source and MLOps. [Crane Venture Partners](https://crane.vc/) from London
is leading our 2.7m USD round followed by
[AIX Ventures](http://aixventures.com/), a new AI fund from Palo Alto. We’re
really looking forward to joining forces and their portfolios alongside
[H2O.ai](https://H2O.ai), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), or
[Weights & Biases](https://huggingface.co/).

In the following, we'd like to take you on our journey and why we are so excited
for the future.

## How it developed

We didn't wake up one day and get an epiphany: "Hey, let's build an MLOps
tool!". In our first startup, we brought Machine Learning into production by
hand for special use-cases, namely
[predictive maintenance for the commercial vehicle industry](https://stories.xpreneurs.io/maiot-d59bc0e0d188?gi=c2c9e36eff61).
The projects looked very similar on the surface but we had to adapt quickly for
every project. Different legacy tools, IT development processes and modalities
required us to stay fully flexible. At the start, every pipeline we created was
for one specific use case - this wasn't scalable or reproducible. The handover
points of data science teams, ML and DevOps engineers created a lot of friction
during all processes - from experimentation to production. This lack of
standardization caused us to consistently confront
[the ownership dilemma](https://blog.zenml.io/ml-pipeline-challenge/) in MLOps.

There are an
[increasing number of tools](https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html) for
all personas across the ML pipeline. However, we noticed that most tools
separate workflows into islands that mainly concentrate on the early development
phase for data scientists, or the later deployment phase which is largely owned
by engineering. This causes systemic failures in the entire system like a lack
of reproducibility or provenance across the pipeline.

Older principles like the division of labor in the
[pin factory](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2019/03/11/FullStackDS-Generalists/)
cannot be applied in machine learning as all inputs are changing constantly. We
believe that the central focus should be the data scientist, the driving mind
and the core creator of value of any ML project. Their skills concentrate on the
creative stage of experimentation. But they are not trained to write, run, and
maintain entire ML pipelines.

## How does ZenML help?

ZenML is built to tackle the ownership dilemma within ML teams. It is designed
with higher level abstractions that enable the data scientist to
[own the pipeline fully until production](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/end-to-end-data-science/).
The data scientist won't need to understand the details of the infrastructure or
deployment tools but will be able to use them through ZenML.

![The problem that ZenML seeks to solve]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/why_zenml/sam-side-by-side-full-text.png)

ZenML is written in Python, the lingua franca of data science. Workflows are
standardized through simply Python functions linked together in a pipeline:

```python
# pseudo-code
from zenml.integrations.awesome_validation_library.steps import validate
from zenml.integrations.awesome_deployment_library.steps import deploy

@step
def import_() -> Output(train_df=pd.Dataframe, test_df=pd.Dataframe):
  ...
  return train_df, test_df

@step
def train() -> torch.nn.Module:
  return model

@pipeline
def my_pipeline(importer, trainer, validator, deployer):
  train_df, val_df = importer()
  model = trainer(train_df)
  # deploy if results are good
  results = validator(model, val_df) deployer(model, results)

my_pipeline(import_, train, validate, deploy).run()
```

There are of course other tools out there that look similar to the above, but
because ZenML is focused on ML workflows, here are some key advantages:

- Pipelines are data dependent, rather than task dependent. This means that
  artifacts flowing through pipelines can be modeled in a specific way to enable
  features like caching and lineage.
- Artifacts flowing through pipeline steps can be standardized (adding a
  standard validation and deployment step for standard data and model
  artifacts).
- Steps can be standardized to enable the same effect. You can then enable
  special features for certain steps (e.g. distributed training for the trainer
  step).
- ZenML can materialize (read/write) common objects like Pandas dataframes and
  PyTorch modules automatically, regardless of the environment in which this
  pipeline is running (local or in the cloud). The data scientist can then use
  these objects natively as they always do.

This sets ZenML apart from tools like Airflow/Luigi/Prefect that are focused on
data engineering use-cases and
[hard to implement for ML-specific tasks](https://huyenchip.com/2021/09/13/data-science-infrastructure.html)
by both developers and data scientists.

All this is from the point of view of an application, but what about
infrastructure? Even with all the advantages above, these pipelines and
integrations need to work across varied environments and infrastructure
requirements for any use-case. This is where the notion of a MLOps stack comes
in.

![Registering a ZenML stack]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/why_zenml/stack.png)

Right now, the stack consists of:

- an orchestrator, to manage running the workflows (e.g.
  [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/))
- a metadata store, a database to track runs and artifacts across the artifact
  store
- an artifact store, a file system to store artifacts (AWS/GCP/Azure bucket)

We can then simply do:

```bash
zenml stack up
```

This spins up the infrastructure for you on a target of your choosing. In
addition, ZenML takes care of deploying your pipelines to the relevant stack
automatically. e.g. Try spinning up a Kubeflow-based stack on your local machine
with this simple command. ZenML will build the container for you, create the
Kubeflow pipeline, and run it automatically, with a simple command. In the
future, we hope to expand this to include more complex deployments.

## What's next and what will we do with the funding?

In the last few months, we have rewritten the ZenML codebase to be more robust
and user-friendly. We have also tripled our team in the space of a few months.
Today, [we released ZenML 0.5.5](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases)
that includes support for writing pipelines with standard artifacts like
Tensorflow or PyTorch models with Kubeflow. Check out the full example in the
docs.

A big part of our current efforts is focusing on integrating awesome third-party
tooling libraries like [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) /
[WhyLogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) /
[GreatExpectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) for validation and
[BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) /
[Seldon](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) /
[KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve) for deployment. You can see our
progress in our [open community roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) and/or our
[open list of integrations](https://docs.zenml.io/features/integrations).

The challenges ahead are huge but we have motivation and now also the funds to
let our vision become reality. We can’t do that without the support of an active
community. If the goals of ZenML align with your vision of the future of MLOps,
[jump over to our Github](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml#readme), give us a
star, and write your first ZenML pipeline today!
