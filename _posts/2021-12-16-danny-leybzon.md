This week, we spoke with Danny Leybzon, currently working with
[WhyLabs](https://whylabs.ai/) to help data scientists monitor their models in
production and prevent model performance from degrading. He previously worked as
a kind of roving data scientist and engineer, helping companies put their models
into production. We were lucky to get to speak to Danny in our new episode of
[_Pipeline Conversations_](https://podcast.zenml.io).

You can get a taste of the discussion with this clip, in which Danny explains
why it's a problem if you only think about starting to monitor your model after
it's already been deployed.

We had a really interesting discussion of some of the ways that tooling and the
general context for data science sometimes lets practitioners down, and of
course we also discussed why monitoring and logging is actually a kind of
baseline practice that should be part of any and every data scientist's toolkit.
Luckily for us, Danny added in a bunch of examples from his wide experience
doing all this in the real world. Check out out the full episode below or
however you prefer to listen to podcasts!
