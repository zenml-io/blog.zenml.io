![Release 0.22.0](../assets/posts/release_0_22_0/Release_0.22.0.jpg)

It's been a while since we last released a new feature.
That's because we've been busy in the past month with the [Month of MLOps competition](./2022-09-26-mlops-competition.md) and fixing various technical debts after our [major 0.20.0 release](./2022-10-05-zenml-revamped.md).

This time around, we are back to shipping new features to you!

In [ZenML 0.22.0](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.22.0) we present to you a brand new [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.com/) integration and a revamped Airflow Orchestrator!

Let's dive right into the changes.

## üç± BentoML Integration

The BentoML integration has been on our radar for some time now and we finally took the time to flesh it out with the help of our contributors [Tim Cvetko](https://github.com/timothy102) and [Aaron Pham](https://github.com/aarnphm).

The new [BentoML integration](https://zenml.io/integrations/bentoml) includes a BentoML model deployer component that lets you deploy models using major machine learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow, HuggingFace, [etc](https://www.bentoml.com/)) on your local machine and in the cloud.

We will showcase the BentoML integration in our next community hour (23rd Nov 2022, 5:30PM CET). 
Want to see it in action? Join us [here](https://zenml.io/meet).

In the meantime, check out the [BentoML example]((https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/bentoml_deployment)) on our repo.

## üöÄ Airflow in the Clouds

The previous Airflow orchestrator was limited to local runs and we had many additional unpleasant constraints.
It's a pain to work with. So, we've completely rewritten the Airflow orchestrator. Now, it works both locally and with remote Airflow deployments!

Watch the demo video below to see the revamped Airflow orchestrator in action.

And also, check out the example of the brand-new Airflow orchestrator [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/airflow_orchestration).


## üíî Breaking Changes

The revamped Airflow orchestrator comes with a breaking change. 
The Airflow orchestrator now requires a newer version of Airflow and Docker installed to work.

You can simply run `zenml integration install airflow` to update your installations to the correct versions.

## ü™≤ Notable Bug Fixes and Improvements

You can now use the ZenML Label Studio integration with non-local (i.e. deployed) instances. For more information, see the [Label Studio documentation](https://docs.zenml.io/component-gallery/annotators/label-studio).
The Label Studio [example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/label_studio_annotation) walks through how you can set it up on cloud infrastructures like Azure, GCP, and AWS.

We fixed the Spark [example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/spark_distributed_programming) and it now works again end-to-end.

We also included a fix that speeds up the data sync from the MLMD database to the ZenML server. 

As usual, we also made various minor improvements which you can view [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/edit/0.22.0).
