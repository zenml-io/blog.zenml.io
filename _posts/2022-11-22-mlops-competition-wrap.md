You did it! Thank you so much to all who submitted entries for the competition. We've been having so much fun going through the demos and repos that we received. The work now falls on us and our external panel of judges to go through the submissions in detail, select the best ones to receive prizes and offer feedback on the material we received.

Our MLOps Competition runs from October 10 to November 11, 2022. Full details will be shared with registered competitors via email, but for now you can learn some more about how the competition will be run in the video above and in the text that follows.

## üí•Competition Recap

We're also really excited to be able to announce our judging panel for the competition, a stellar cast of ML and MLOps heroes!

- [Charles Frye](https://twitter.com/charles_irl), core instructor at the amazing [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com) course
- [Anthony Goldbloom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonygoldbloom), co-founder and former CEO of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- [Chip Huyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/), author of '[Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Huyen-ebook-dp-B0B1LGL2SR/dp/B0B1LGL2SR/ref=mt_other?qid=1653630445&me=&tag=soumet-20&_encoding=UTF8)' and co-founder of Claypot AI

For more information on the competition, please visit [zenml.io/competition](https://zenml.io/competition). You can find all the links to sign up for the competition there as well as information on the prizes and judging criteria!

We have some great prizes ranging from a first prize of $750 USD down to two $100 USD prizes for beginners just starting out in the world of MLOps. You'll also get feedback and support from the ZenML team during the weeks of the competition, so it's a great opportunity to learn about the full stack of machine learning.

Aside from the cash prizes, joining in the competition is a great way to contribute to open-source software, to build your machine learning portfolio, and to learn MLOps best practices. You'll build a pipeline that solves a problem of your choosing, and go from zero to production ML in just a few days!

To take part, sign up [at the competition page](https://zenml.io/competition) and we will send you full details as we get closer to the competition. Participation can be as structured (or not!) as you wish: advanced users can implement their project however they'd like, while beginners in the field of MLOps or first-time ZenML users will have a semi-guided structure within which we suggest you iteratively build your submission.

We recommend you form a small team (max 5 people) to tackle whatever challenge you decide to work on. If you don't have anyone to team up with, feel free to post requests for teams on the #competition channel on the ZenML slack as there are likely to be others in the same situation!

We're really excited to dive into the competition in a couple of weeks and we look forward to seeing all the creative and ingenious ideas you come up with!

## ü•° Takeaways

While the entire competition was a huge learning experience for everyone involved, there were
particular takeaways that our judges articulated well as they went through the submissions:

- The standard of submissions was generally high
- People used ZenML in many different contexts
- The biggest factor of not being able to submit a project was **transitioning to the cloud**.

## ‚û°Ô∏è What's next

The Month of MLOps was one of the most enjoyable moments in the history of ZenML - and
