**Last updated:** October 17, 2022.

This first episode of [Pipeline Conversations](https://podcast.zenml.io/) is the kick-off for a series of
talks in the broader Machine Learning Start-Up Space. Our goal is not to promote
any product or company but to discuss and also educate the community on
different topics. We will invite thought leaders in the MLOps space, talk about
how to build an open-source startup in public, and also the biggest challenges
in Machine Learning. There won't be a strict script and our guests will mainly
determine the content.

Alex Strick van Linschoten is the initiator and host of [**Pipeline Conversations**](https://podcast.zenml.io/).
He's a musician by heart, holds PhD in history, wrote several books about his
research before he got into coding and Machine Learning. His background will
give a different perspective to the upcoming talks and we are super excited to
have him building ZenML with us!

This episode is an introduction to ZenML and its founders, Hamza and myself. We
talk about our passion, our journey of how we met, what we initially wanted to
build and how we ended up starting ZenML in the MLOps space.

We address questions on every level: What is MLOps? Why is this not solved
already? Aren't there a ton of MLOps Tools out there already? Where is it coming
from? Who will need it? Where do we envision ZenML to be and what are the next
steps getting there? We're talking about the movement to standardization, best
practices in ML, the right level of abstraction and ZenML as the Autobahn of ML
tooling.

The next episode will be with a "real" guest. We already have a long list but
would love to hear your recommendations. Send us a mail to
[podcast@zenml.io](mailto:podcast@zenml.io). Stay tuned!
