When a customer stops using a business for its services or products, we call that 'churn.' We can calculate a churn rate for a company by dividing the number of customers who churned by the total number of customers and then multiplying that number by 100 to reach a percentage value. If you want to learn more about customer churn, you can read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churn_rate). 

In this article, I show how I used a ZenML pipeline to build a customer churn model and present two deployment options:-

- `Deployment using Kubeflow Pipelines`: I will be using [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/) to build and run our ZenML pipeline on the cloud and deploy it in a production environment.
- `Continuous Deployment using Seldon Core`: I will be using [Seldon Core](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/index.html), a production-grade open-source model serving platform, to build our continuous deployment pipeline that trains a model and then serves it with Seldon Core.

I will be using the [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?datasetId=13996&sortBy=voteCount) dataset for building an end to end production-grade machine learning system that can predict whether the customer will stay loyal or not. The dataset has 20 input features and a target variable for 7043 customers.

## Deployment using Kubeflow Pipelines

To build a real-world workflow for predicting whether a customer will churn or not, you will probably develop your pipelines on your local machine initially, allowing for quick iteration and debugging. However, at a certain point, when you are finished with its design, you might want to transition to a more production-ready setting and deploy the pipeline to a more robust environment. This is where ZenML comes in.

I will be using ZenML's [Kubeflow](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/kubeflow) integration to deploy pipelines to production using Kubeflow Pipelines on the cloud.

Our training pipeline `run_kubeflow_pipeline.py` consists of the following steps:

![PipelineStepExplanation](/assets/posts/customer-churn/pipelinestepsexplanation.png)

- `ingest_data`: Ingest the data from the source and create a DataFrame.
- `encode_cat_cols`: Encode categorical columns.
- `handle_imbalanced_data`: Handle imbalanced data.
- `drop_cols`: Dropping irrelevant columns.
- `data_splitter`: Split the data into training and test sets.
- `model_trainer`: Train, the model.
- `evaluation`: Evaluate the trained model.

if you want to run the pipeline with `default` stack settings, you can run the following command:

```bash
zenml stack set default
python run_kubeflow_pipeline.py
```

### Run the same pipeline on a local Kubeflow Pipelines deployment

Previously I ran our pipeline in default stack settings; now, I will transition our pipeline to a more production-ready stage and deploy the pipeline to a more robust environment. In this section, I will run the same pipeline on a local Kubeflow Pipelines deployment.

With all the installation and initialization out of the way, all that's left to do is configure our ZenML stack. For this example, the stack we create consists of the following four parts:

- The **local artifact store** stores step outputs on your hard disk.
- The **local metadata store** stores metadata like the pipeline name and step
  parameters inside a local SQLite database.
- The Docker images created to run your pipeline are stored in a local
  Docker **container registry**.
- The **Kubeflow orchestrator** is responsible for running your ZenML pipeline
  in Kubeflow Pipelines.

```bash
# Make sure to create the local registry on port 5000 for it to work
zenml container-registry register local_registry --type=default --uri=localhost:5000
zenml orchestrator register kubeflow_orchestrator --type=kubeflow
zenml stack register local_kubeflow_stack \
    -m local_metadata_store \
    -a local_artifact_store \
    -o kubeflow_orchestrator \
    -c local_registry

# Activate the newly-created stack
zenml stack set local_kubeflow_stack
```

Now, we need to start the Kubeflow Pipelines stack locally; all we need to do is run:

```bash
zenml stack up
```

We can now run the pipeline by simply executing the Python script:

```bash
python run_kubeflow_pipeline.py
```

By running the script, it will build a Docker image containing all the necessary Python packages and
files, push it to the local container registry and schedule a pipeline run-in
Kubeflow Pipelines. Once the script is finished, you should be able to see the
pipeline run [here](http://localhost:8080/#/runs).

### Transitioning to Production with Kubeflow on AWS

Now I will transition our pipeline to a more production-ready setting and deploy it in a more robust environment because I don't want to deploy our pipeline locally; I want to deploy it on the cloud. In this section, I will run the same pipeline on a Kubeflow Pipelines deployment on AWS.

There are two steps to continue:

- Set up the necessary cloud resources on the provider of your choice
- Configure ZenML with a new stack to be able to communicate with these resources

I will now run the same pipeline in Kubeflow Pipelines deployed to an AWS EKS cluster. Before running this, you need some additional setup or prerequisites to run the pipeline on AWS: you can refer to our [documentation](https://docs.zenml.io/features/guide-aws-gcp-azure#pre-requisites), which will help you get set up to run the pipeline on AWS.

If you want to run the pipeline on other cloud providers like GCP or Azure, you can follow [this guide](https://docs.zenml.io/features/guide-aws-gcp-azure) for more information on those cloud providers. We will be using AWS for this project, but feel free to use any cloud provider.

The following diagram showcases our Kubeflow stack on AWS:

![CloudKubeflowStack](/assets/posts/customer-churn/aws_kubeflow_stack.png)

Now, I will configure the Kubeflow Pipelines stack on AWS and run the pipeline on AWS; the following are the steps for doing so:

1. Install the cloud provider

```bash
zenml integration install aws
```

2. Register the stack components

```bash
zenml container-registry register cloud_registry --type=default --uri=$PATH_TO_YOUR_CONTAINER_REGISTRY
zenml orchestrator register cloud_orchestrator --type=kubeflow --custom_docker_base_image_name=YOUR_IMAGE
zenml metadata-store register kubeflow_metadata_store --type=kubeflow
zenml artifact-store register cloud_artifact_store --type=s3 --path=$PATH_TO_YOUR_BUCKET

# Register the cloud stack
zenml stack register cloud_kubeflow_stack -m kubeflow_metadata_store -a cloud_artifact_store -o cloud_orchestrator -c cloud_registry
```

3. Activate the newly-created stack

```bash
zenml stack set cloud_kubeflow_stack
```

4. Run the pipeline

```shell
python run_kubeflow_pipeline.py
```

5. Configure port Forwarding and check the Kubeflow UI to see if the model is deployed and running! ðŸš€

```bash
kubectl --namespace kubeflow port-forward svc/ml-pipeline-ui 8080:80
```

Now, to see the UI, you can go to [the localhost URL](http://localhost:8080/#/runs). If everything is working, you should see the model deployed and running as below:
![SuccessfulPipelineRun](/assets/posts/customer-churn/runsuccesskubeflow.png)

### Connecting Kubeflow Pipelines with Streamlit

We have a running pipeline deployed using Kubeflow Pipelines on AWS; Now, I will connect the pipeline to a data application like Streamlit to use the model for prediction. The following code is the core logic for connecting the pipeline to Streamlit.

```python
repo = Repository()
p = repo.get_pipeline("training_pipeline")
last_run = p.runs[-1]
trainer_step = last_run.get_step("model_trainer")
model = trainer_step.output.read()

input_details = [..., ..., ...]
pred = model.predict(input_details)
```

I'm fetching the `training_pipeline` from the ZenML repository and taking the last run of the pipeline. Then, I'm bringing the `model_trainer` step from the previous run and reading the model from the `model_trainer` step. After that, I fetch the input details from the user and use the model to predict the output.

You can run the Streamlit app by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_apps/streamlit_app_kubeflow.py
```

## Continuous model deployment with Seldon Core

While building the real-world workflow for predicting whether a customer will churn or not, you might not want to train the model once and deploy it to production. Instead, you might want to train the model and deploy it to production when something gets triggered. This is where one of our recent integrations is valuable: [Seldon Core](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/seldon_deployment).

[Seldon Core](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) is a production-grade open-source model serving platform. It packs a wide range of features built around deploying models to REST/GRPC microservices, including monitoring and logging, model explainers, outlier detectors, and various continuous deployment strategies such as A/B testing and canary deployments, and more.

In this project, I built a continuous deployment pipeline that trains a model and then serves it with Seldon Core as the industry-ready model deployment tool of choice. If you are interested in learning more about Seldon Core, you can check out the [ZenML example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/seldon_deployment). The following diagram shows the flow of the whole pipeline:
![seldondeployment](/assets/posts/customer-churn/seldoncorecontinousdeployment.gif)

Let's set up our full AWS stack to run the pipeline using Seldon Core.

1. Install the Seldon Core integration, a set of ZenML extensions that integrate with Seldon Core.

```bash
zenml integration install seldon
```

2. Register the stack components

```bash
aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name zenml-cluster --alias zenml-eks
```

To configure ECR registry access locally, run, e.g.:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS \
  --password-stdin 715803424590.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

Extract the URL where the Seldon Core model server exposes its prediction API, e.g.:

```bash
export INGRESS_HOST=$(kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}')
```

Configuring the stack can be done like this:

```shell
zenml integration install s3 aws kubeflow Seldon

zenml artifact-store register aws --type=s3 --path=s3://mybucket
zenml model-deployer register seldon_aws --type=seldon \
  --kubernetes_context=zenml-eks --kubernetes_namespace=kubeflow \
  --base_url=http://$INGRESS_HOST \
  --secret=s3-store
zenml container-registry register aws --type=default --uri=715803424590.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
zenml metadata-store register aws --type=kubeflow
zenml orchestrator register aws --type=kubeflow --kubernetes_context=zenml-eks --synchronous=True
zenml secrets-manager register aws -t aws
zenml stack register aws -m aws -a aws -o aws -c aws -d seldon_aws -x aws
zenml stack set aws
```

The following diagram explains our pipeline and stack components in much more detail:
![seldondeploymentstackaws](/assets/posts/customer-churn/aws_stack_seldon.png)

4. Do a pipeline run

```shell
python run_seldon_deployment_pipeline.py --secret Seldon-init-container-secret --deploy
```

You can control which pipeline to run, bypassing the `--deploy` and the `--predict` flag to the `run_seldon_deployment_pipeline.py` launcher. If you run the pipeline with the `--deploy` flag, the pipeline will train the model and deploy if the model meets the evaluation criteria, and then Seldon Core will serve the model for inference. If you run the pipeline with the `--predict` flag, this tells the pipeline only to run the inference pipeline and not the training pipeline.

You can also set the `--min-accuracy` to control the evaluation criteria.

5. Configure port Forwarding and check the Kubeflow UI to see if the model is deployed and running! ðŸš€

```bash
kubectl --namespace kubeflow port-forward svc/ml-pipeline-ui 8080:80
```

Now, to see the UI, you can go to the [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/#/runs). If everything is working, you should see the model deployed and running as below:
![SuccessfulPipelineRunContinuous](/assets/posts/customer-churn/continous_deployment_pipeline.png)

If you want to run the pipeline with the `--predict` flag, you can run the following command to run the pipeline:

```bash
python run_seldon_deployment_pipeline.py --secret seldon-init-container-secret --predict
```

This will run the inference pipeline that will serve the model for inference. You can check the model is serving by going to the [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/#/runs) and see the model is serving as below in your inference pipeline run:
![SuccessfulPipelineRunInference](/assets/posts/customer-churn/inferencepipelinerun.png)

### Connecting Seldon Core Pipelines with Streamlit

Now I have deployed our pipeline using Seldon Core. I'm going to connect the pipeline with Streamlit to make inferences from our model service. The following code is the core logic for connecting the pipeline to Streamlit:

```python
from zenml.services import load_last_service_from_step
service = load_last_service_from_step(
            pipeline_name="continuous_deployment_pipeline",
            step_name="model_deployer",
            running=True,
        )
input_details = [..., ..., ...]
data = np.array(input_details)
pred = service.predict(input_details)
```

I'm fetching our `model_deployer` step from the `continuous_deployment_pipeline` pipeline and retrieving the model service using the `load_last_service_from_step` function, making use of the `predict` method to make an inference.

## What we learned

In this blog post, I showed you how to build a model that can predict whether a customer will leave the company or not. I also showed you how to deploy our pipeline using Kubeflow Pipelines and Seldon Core on AWS. I also showed you how to connect the pipeline with Streamlit to infer from our model service.
